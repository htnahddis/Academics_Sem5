This GitHub repository is dedicated to maintaining all my academic experiments in a structured and transparent manner. The primary objective of this repository is to document my daily progress, ensuring that every experiment is properly recorded with systematic and meaningful Git commits.

By following this practice, I aim to:

Demonstrate consistency in completing academic work on a daily basis.

Maintain an organized and traceable history of experiments and their outcomes.

Provide verifiable proof of work that can be shared with teachers and mentors for review.

Develop disciplined coding and version control habits that align with professional standards.

Overall, this repository not only serves as a personal archive of my academic journey but also as evidence of my commitment to learning, accountability, and continuous improvement.
